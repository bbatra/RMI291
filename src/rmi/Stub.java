/** RMI stub factory.

 <p>
 RMI stubs hide network communication with the remote server and provide a
 simple object-like interface to their users. This class provides methods for
 creating stub objects dynamically, when given pre-defined interfaces.

 <p>
 The network address of the remote server is set when a stub is created, and
 may not be modified afterwards. Two stubs are equal if they implement the
 same interface and carry the same remote server address - and would
 therefore connect to the same skeleton. Stubs are serializable.
